        <h1>Benchmark</h1>

        <p>
            Deepkit advertises high performance in many places and has high performance as top priority. 
            We don't only say that, we want to back that with actual data. 
            That's why we have a full <a href="https://github.com/deepkit/deepkit-framework/tree/master/packages/benchmark/src">suite of benchmarks</a> 
            where we ran our code against other libraries.
            We plan to setup a pipeline that automatically executes those benchmarks for every commit and track exactly
            where we have potential to improve. For the moment we execute them on a machine and publish the report on our product sites.
        </p>

        <p>
            In order to execute the benchmarks on your own machine, you have to checkout the deepkit-framework repository, install all dependencies,
            build the source, and then execute the benchmark you want.
        </p>

            $ git clone https://github.com/deepkit/deepkit-framework.git
            $ cd deepkit-framework
            $ npm install
            $ npm run bootstrap

        <p>
            Now you are in the <code>packages/benchmark</code> folder and can use <code>npm run benchmark NAME</code> to execute a benchmark.

            Note: Make sure your CPU is not throttled and not busy with other tasks. Also make sure enough memory is available.

        <h3>Broker benchmark</h3>
        
        <p>
            Note that in the redis benchmark the redis server uses a separate thread while Deepkit Broker runs single-threaded, which makes it in theory unfair.
            But it can keep up with it regardless of that fact.
